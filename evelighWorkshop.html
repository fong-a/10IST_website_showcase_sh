        <p>The Eveleigh Railway Workshops, also known as the Eveleigh Carriage Workshops, is a 
          former railway workshop located in the suburb of Redfern in Sydney. It was one of the 
          largest railway workshops in the Southern Hemisphere, and it played a significant role in 
          the development of the New South Wales railway network.
          The Eveleigh Railway Workshops were established in 1884 by the New South Wales Government 
          Railways, with the construction of a large locomotive erecting and repair shop. Over the 
          following decades, additional workshops and facilities were added to the site, 
          including carriage and wagon workshops, a foundry, a boiler shop, and a machine shop.

      <div class="col2">
        <p>During its peak, the Eveleigh Railway Workshops employed over 5,000 workers and was 
          responsible for the construction, maintenance, and repair of locomotives, carriages, and 
          wagons for the New South Wales Government Railways.
          In the 1980s, the workshop began to decline as the railways were gradually privatized and 
          modernized. The last locomotive was repaired in 1985, and the workshop was closed in 1988.

      <div class="col1">
        <p>The site has been preserved as a heritage site, and there are a number of historic 
          buildings and structures that have been retained, including the Main Workshop, the 
          Erecting Shop, and the Locomotive Office. These buildings and structures provide a
          glimpse into the history of the site and its importance in the development of railways 
          in Australia.

        <p>In addition to the historic buildings, there are also some heritage rail remains on site, 
          including the 3801 Museum and a number of historic locomotives and carriages. The 3801 
          Museum houses locomotive 3801, which is one of the most famous steam locomotives in 
          Australia, and there are a number of other historic locomotives and carriages on display 
          as well. Visitors to the site can take guided tours and learn more about the history of 
          railways in Australia and the important role that the Eveleigh Locomotive Workshops played 
          in their development.
