      <div class="col1">
        <p>The history of the Lithgow Zig Zag dates back to the 1860s, when the New 
          South Wales Government Railways began construction of a railway line through 
          the Blue Mountains to connect Sydney with the western parts of the state. 
          The steep terrain of the region posed a major engineering challenge, and 
          engineers devised a series of switchbacks, or zig zags, to allow trains to 
          descend the mountain slopes safely.

      <div class="col2">
        <p>The original Lithgow Zig Zag operated for over 80 years, until it was 
          replaced by a new, more direct line in the 1910s. However, in the 1970s, 
          a group of railway enthusiasts began lobbying to restore the historic 
          Zig Zag, and in 1975, the Zig Zag Railway was established as a heritage 
          railway.

      <div class="col1">
        <p>Today, the Zig Zag Railway operates a range of heritage locomotives and 
          carriages along the historic Lithgow Zig Zag. The railway offers a range of 
          experiences, from short rides on a vintage steam train to full-day 
          excursions that include stops at historic stations and scenic lookout points.

        <p>In addition to its railway operations, the Zig Zag Railway also offers a 
          range of educational and interactive programs, including guided tours, 
          workshops, and special events. These programs are designed to promote an 
          understanding and appreciation of the history of railway transport in the 
          Blue Mountains region, and to inspire future generations of railway 
          enthusiasts.
