        <p>The NSW Rail Museum is located in the town of Thirlmere,
          approximately 90 kilometers southwest of Sydney.
          The museum is home to a large collection of historic locomotives,
          carriages, and other railway equipment, and is operated by
          Transport Heritage NSW, a division of the New South Wales
          Government.</p>

        <p>The history of the NSW Rail Museum dates back to the 1960s, 
           when a group of railway enthusiasts began collecting and restoring historic 
           railway equipment. In 1975, the collection was formally established as the 
           New South Wales Rail Transport Museum, and in 2016, it was rebranded as the 
           NSW Rail Museum.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col1">
        <p>The museum's collection includes a number of historic steam locomotives, 
          many of which have been restored to operating condition. These include the 
          3265, a 4-6-0 locomotive built in 1892; the 3526, a 4-6-0 locomotive built 
          in 1915; and the 5917, a 2-8-2 locomotive built in 1952. These locomotives 
          are occasionally used for special events and excursions, allowing visitors 
          to experience the thrill of steam travel.
          In addition to its steam locomotives, the museum also houses a large collection 
          of diesel and electric locomotives, as well as carriages and other rolling stock addition
          other historic railway items. The collection spans the entire history of railway 
          transport in New South Wales, from the early steam era to the present day.

        <p>The museum also offers a range of educational and interactive programs, 
          including guided tours, workshops, and special events. These programs are designed
          to promote an understanding and appreciation of the history of railway transport in 
          New South Wales, and to inspire future generations of railway enthusiasts.
